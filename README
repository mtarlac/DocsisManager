Docsis Manager

Simple cable modem manager database tables based on docsis_server with a few 
aditions this was developed to replaced a docsis_server for a isc-dhcp-server
install + tftp server + tod etc...

View the docs directory for details.

I'm not developing this project anylonger but it's still being used by a small
cable operator. This version has small aditions that aren't present in the 
original.

It originally ran on a VM with 512MB RAM 1 CPU qemu-kvm debian connected to a NFS
server where the files were stored.

Current code allows dependencies install via composer just run:

*composer install*

- Create directory cache/db with your webserver user permissions

- import SQL dump to your named database the file is **install_mysql.sql** in the docs directory

- Configure application/configs/application.ini

- default user is admin , default password is adminadmin

- Directory cm_templates holds default docsis templates for cable modems

- Create "gen" directory in the root of the webapp this will keep generated docsis
configuration, should be with permissions for your web server user

- docs/README.txt has virtual host example for apache please enable URL_REWRITE 
has this is a ZF1 install

- docs has other details on install and configuration

- YOU MUST HAVE INSTALLED docsis tool witch can be found in sourceforge

- **Errors** are logged to /tmp/docsismanager.log  /tmp is a example what is used 
is the return of sys_get_temp_dir() wich is usually /tmp
