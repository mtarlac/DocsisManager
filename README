Docsis Manager

Simple cable modem manager database tables based on docsis_server with a few 
aditions this was developed to replaced a docsis_server for a isc-dhcp-server
install + tftp server + tod etc...

View the docs directory for details.

I'm not developing this project anylonger but it's still being used by a small
cable operator. This version has small aditions that aren't present in the 
original.

It originally ran on a VM with 512MB RAM 1 CPU qemu-kvm debian connected to a NFS
server where the files were stored.
